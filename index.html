    <h2>What We Want</h2>

	  <p style="padding-bottom:50px; padding-left:500px; padding-right:500px">The
			reimplementation of Bird electric scooters throughout the University
      of Georgia campus in cooperation with administration and campus police in an
      effort to benefit the general student body and accomplish university
      sustainability goals</p>

    <h2>The Full Story</h2>

    <h3>Aug. 14th...</h3>
	    <p>Bird introduced hundreds of electric scooters throughout campus, downtown
         Athens, and the surrounding area. This introduction coincided with similar
         introductions on 149 other college campuses. </p>
    <h3>Following Week...</h3>
	    <p>Students flocked to the new transportation service, utilizing the
        scooters to get to class, get food, and just move about their day and
        they took to social media to share their praise.</p>
    <h3>The Conflict...</h3>
	    <p style="padding-bottom:50px">Students were unaware of the rules regarding where you can and cannot
         park and drive the vehicles. As a result, campus administration and
         campus police began impounding scooters and issuing citations to
         students.</p>

    <h2>Plan of Action</h2>

    <ol style="padding-bottom:50px">
      <li>Contact Bird and return any currently impounded scooters</li>
      <li>Establish a relationship with Bird to implement a plan for
        proper education on usage and safety</li>
      <li>Work with campus organizations to deploy the education plan
        and properly inform students on Bird usage</li>
      <li>Allow Bird to slowly reintroduce the electric scooters throughout
        campus in a phased approach</li>
      <li>Continue enforcing rules and regulations regarding usage</li>
      <li>Make adaptations to the education plan based on the initial
        success of the phased introduction</li>
      <li>Fully reintroduce Bird electric scooters throughout campus</li>
